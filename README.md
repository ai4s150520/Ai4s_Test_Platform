# AI4S Online Test Platform


<!-- Replace the placeholder URL above with a real screenshot of your application's homepage -->

A robust, full-stack web application designed for creating, managing, and taking online assessments, with a primary focus on SAP modules. This platform provides a seamless, role-based experience for students and administrators, featuring a modern UI, a secure backend, and a professional-grade feature set.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This platform is divided into two primary experiences: a feature-rich portal for students and a powerful content management system for administrators.

### üéì For Students & Users
*   **Secure Authentication:** User registration and login with support for both username and email. Includes a secure "Forgot Password" flow.
*   **Interactive Test Catalog:** A fully responsive gallery of all published tests with live searching and filtering by category and difficulty.
*   **Detailed Test Previews:** A dedicated "enrollment" page for each test, providing a full description, topics covered, duration, and number of questions before the user begins.
*   **Timed Exam Interface:** A clean, focused, and timed environment for taking tests, complete with a real-time progress bar.
*   **Instant Results & History:** Users see their score and pass/fail status immediately after submission. A personal dashboard tracks their entire test history.

### ‚öôÔ∏è For Administrators (Staff)
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** A clear distinction between regular users and staff. Administrative pages and controls are completely inaccessible to students.
*   **Front-End Content Management:** Admins can create, manage, and delete tests and questions entirely through the website's UI‚Äîno need to use the backend Django Admin for content.
*   **Flexible Question Posting:**
    *   **Manual Entry:** An intuitive form for adding questions and answers one by one.
    *   **Bulk Upload via JSON:** A powerful feature to upload hundreds of questions at once from a structured JSON file.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** A central hub showing platform statistics (total users, tests, attempts) and a live feed of recent user activity.
*   **Manual Publishing Control:** Admins have a toggle switch on each test's management page to manually publish or unpublish it, giving them full control over test visibility.
