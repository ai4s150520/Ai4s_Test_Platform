SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-a-local-dev-secret-key-that-does-not-matter-for-local
DEBUG=1
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# --- PostgreSQL Container Settings ---
# These are used by the 'db' service in docker-compose.yml to initialize the database.
POSTGRES_DB=ai4s_db
POSTGRES_USER=ai4s_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Sachin@123

# --- Database URL for Django ---
# This is what Django's settings.py will read to connect to the PostgreSQL container.
# The credentials must match the POSTGRES_ variables above.
DATABASE_URL=postgres://ai4s_user:Sachin@123@db:5432/ai4s_db

# --- Google Cloud Storage (IMPORTANT) ---
# For local development, this variable should be commented out or not present.
# This forces settings.py to use the 'else' block for local file storage.
